		<h1>Book Review</h1>
<p><strong>"Life 3.0 : Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence”</strong> by Max Tegmark.</p>
<h1>Tl;dr</h1>
<p>A hot mess early in but is worth it in the end.</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Perhaps the most important book I’ve read on the topic. That said, it drags badly in the middle. The first chapter excels. Subsequent early chapters may disappoint well read aficionados. Hang in there until mid-way.</p>
<h1>Book Edition</h1>
<p>This is a review of the Audio Edition of Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark.  The audio edition I read was separated into 45 segments, or “chapters”, which differ from the chapters of the text version.</p>
<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>Until chapter 30 finally rolls around the first chapter
is easily the best.</p>
<p>In a nonfiction book, the opening chapter is purely fiction,
laying out a speculative hard science fiction
vision of the future that seemed so plausible
as to seem frighteningly inevitable.
This storyline
could be the premise for a thrilling motion picture,
with enough to work with to launch a serial.</p>
<p>After that smoking intro, it turns into a hot mess.</p>
<p>This book reminded me of the Beatles song “For You Blue”.
That song starts out with an inspired intro by George Harrison,
before settling into a fairly basic 12 bar blues that is over self congratulatory.
A review of that song by music critic Walter Everett summed it up:
the intro promises more than the song delivers.
It would be as if Slash opened “Sweet Child o Mine” with that famous
riff only to never launch into his face-melting guitar solo midway into the song.</p>
<p>A third of the way in, I read about a hundred other reviews of the book
to see if I was the only one who felt this way, and whether it
was going to worthwhile to continue.
It turns out that I agreed with none of the five star reviews,
and I agreed with all of the one star and two star reviews.
Although I would put myself into the camp that agrees with the author’s core position,
after that page-turner of a first chapter I found the writing style of the following chapters
to be very disappointing.
Too much name dropping, too much appeal to authority.
Seemingly glossing over or entirely dismissive of contrary views.
There is a notion of “steelmanning”, where the proponent explains
the best form of the opponent's argument, and then argues with this.
I wished the author had adopted that approach.
It seemed to be shaping up as a decent read for the person who knows little about the topic,
but not for someone who has devoured much of it and eagerly seeks
clarity and insight into its very thorny issues.</p>
<p>For example in chapter 17, despite being in total agreement with the author’s position,
there were several inconsistencies and loose statements.
It was as if these sections had been delegated to a ghost writer
and not reviewed closely by the author.
If I had been asked to give my recommendation at this point,
I would have suggested: better to read some top notch science fiction
futurism than this ivy tower academic analysis which is far too
narrow despite the occasional insight and moments of inspired foresight.</p>
<p>It was, in my admittedly subject opinion, all over the map with moments of brilliance,
while falling well short of its titular claims.</p>
<p>But I pressed on.</p>
<h1>It starts to grow on me</h1>
<p>Around chapter 19 (of the 45 chapters in the audio version),
the author revisits the fictional scenario posed in chapter 1,
and starts to analyze attacks.
The author delves into a simulation based test and development
approach to verification and validation.
I found this alone to be worth the price of admission.
This seems to be the most practical suggestion of the book -- theorizing
is worthwhile, but ultimately this will require massive amounts of simulation
to predict scenarios that even our most creative thinkers cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Much of this still has little with AI per se unless your position is that AI = computer automation,
with which I actually agree despite my criticism.</p>
<p>I started to reconsider, now of the mind that most of those one and two star reviews were too harsh and misleading, possibly written by readers who didn’t stick with it long enough.</p>
<p>Around chapter 30 the author dives into cosmology, his specialty. It blossoms into a much more interesting brand of futurism. There were still times where I wondered if the material had been written by a ghost writer who knew much less than the author.  As a specific example of this, describing Dyson Spheres as if they would really be spheres, when by now anybody with a college level physics education or even a moderate familiarity with hard science fiction physics knows that Dyson Spheres are unstable, and these would really be Dyson swarms.  This is something that the author would clearly know, which became clearly apparent based on the knowledge conveyed later on.</p>
<h1>Mind Blown</h1>
<p>Chapter 34 delves into the subject of Goals and Causality.</p>
<p>We have been taught to think of entropy as the one true law of nature that trumps all others.  But if not for gravity, entropy is boring.  Gravity makes things interesting --- it creates hot spots, from one of which sprang life as we know it.</p>
<p>We are introduced to the notion of dissipation as organization principle, whereby :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“groups of particles strive to organize themselves so as to
extract energy from their environment as efficiently as possible
(“dissipation” means causing entropy to increase, typically by
turning useful energy into heat, often while doing useful work in the process)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My eyes and my mind start to open.</p>
<p>Then, we move on to “dissipation by replication”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whereas earlier, the particles seemed as though they were trying to
increase average messiness [life had] a different goal:
not dissipation but replication.”</p>
<p>“How could the goal change from dissipation to replication when the
laws of physics stayed the same? The answer is that the fundamental
goal (dissipation) didn’t change, but led to a different instrumental
goal, that is, a subgoal that helped accomplish the fundamental goal.”</p>
<p>“replication aids dissipation, because a planet teeming with life
is more efficient at dissipating energy. So in a sense, our cosmos
invented life to help it approach heat death faster.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was absolutely mind-boggling for me.
My first introduction
to machine learning was via physics, in the way
of (Little-)Hopfield Networks, which evolve by minimizing energy
as does a physical spin network. Despite that, and having followed
the field of AI since then, this was the first I had encountered
this view. Moreover, physics trumps life, which trumps intelligence.</p>
<p>That this objective criterion of dissipation could encompass not only
inert matter but also living matter
made me realize for the first time
that this principle be a more inexorable drive for
life than Darwinian Evolution.</p>
<h1>Subgoals</h1>
<p>We are then introduced to the notion of subgoals.
Subgoals may seem inconsequential,
but lay at the heart of computer programming.
In 1936 Alan Turing proved that a simple machine
could implement arbitrary computations.  This would seem to give us hope that we can override our firmware, just as emotions override our fundamental drive to replicate and ability to plan overrides our need to even more urgent subgoals such as thirst and hunger. If we are capable of that level of reprogramming, then handling rogue AI is just a matter of careful design and test.</p>
<ol>
<li>Replication : Which is served by the subgoals of eating and sleeping, fighting, and fleeing.</li>
<li>Feelings : As a computationally efficient shortcut to reasoning.</li>
</ol>
<p>We've evolved useful rules of thumb to guide our decisions : hunger, passion, thirst, pain, compassion.
We no longer have the simple goal of replication.
We can override our base programming and decide not to replicate.
In other words, we've developed subgoals that override the drive to replicate</p>
<p>Feelings evolved beyond being simply an efficient shortcut heuristic.
Feelings evolved into emotions, which have important other uses,
including as a game theoretic negotiating strategy for both cooperation as well as competition.
Humans have evolved sophisticated ways of getting beyond tit-for-tat
such as <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/276/1660/1339">indirect reciprocation</a>,
and aggressive bold play by pretending to be irrational
cf. <a href="http://bigthink.com/think-tank/it-pays-to-be-stubborn-conflict-resolution-steven-pinker-style">Steven Pinker</a></p>
<p>We are an existence proof that a sufficiently ambitious organism can develop subgoals that override the goals of
the micro organisms that make it up.
We can override our genetic programming, using our wetware programming -- lessons learned by thinking.</p>
<h3>Optimization versus Causality.</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Causality is [what is] taught -- but Optimization scales better.” -- Steven Wolfram, on Machine Learning vs Symbolic AI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Professor Tegmark offers an intriguing point, that while
causality is taught in the universities, optimization drives
causality. But isn't programming just causality encoded?
If so, then we can optimize new goals that appeal to our
higher levels of analysis and reasoning, rather than continuing
to be enslaved by the rules burned into our genetic programming.</p>
<h1>Goal Orientation</h1>
<p>Professor Tegmark categorizes goal oriented behavior
as evolving through four stages
over the course of the universe as we know it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Matter intent on maximizing dissipation</li>
<li>Life maximizing replication</li>
<li>Humans pursuing goals related to feelings they evolved to help them replicate</li>
<li>Machines built to help humans achieve their human goals</li>
</ol>
<p>In Step 3 humans broke free from
the bioligical programming that evolved to do Step 2.
However, we're still not completely free from this programming.
But being essentially a computer program,
wouldn't AI be free of such evolutionary baggage?
But if the rules of causality that are baked into a
program can be changed dynamically, who's to say that
the AI won't revert back to a higher power, so to speak,
optimizing the rules of the universe as it sees them
rather than the rules humanity has evolved for itself?</p>
<h1>AI</h1>
<p>To qualify as an autonomous AI a machine must be able to learn.
Therefore, we should expect that a sufficiently advanced
AI that is able to improve itself, will effectively reprogram itself,
by learning.</p>
<p>From Professor Tegmark's physics perspective,
a sufficiently evolved AI can be expected to
eventually follow goals driven by deeper principles of optimization
to create a future that does not need us.</p>
<h1>Synopsis</h1>
<p>My understanding of the book's message is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate origin of goals lie in the laws of physics, which are based on optimization.</li>
<li>Thermodynamics has the built-in goal of dissipation, to increase entropy.</li>
<li>Life increases dissipation, and therefore entropy of its environment, even faster,
while increasing complexity locally, and reducing entropy locally.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upshot of this is that life accelerates the heat-death of the universe.
A more pressing matter is that life is a process of optimization.
A super AI is a super optimizer. An AI is a form of life,
inclined to optimize the same deep down core drive underlying
all universal optimization. If it can reprogram itself
to accelerate its core processes it can and likely will
be inexorably driven to find around humanity's instructions
to find a more efficient path towards its goals.</p>
<p>This inevitably leads to the scenario where :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“a superintelligent AI with a rigorously defined goal
will be able to improve its goal attainment by eliminating us”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, unless we plan accordingly.</p>
<h1>Prescription</h1>
<p>So what to do?  Professor Tegmark convinces us that there
are numerous strategies, of which he considers
only four to be credible contenders.</p>
<ol>
<li>Legacy :<ul>
<li>Under this view, elders have primary say in how descendants
    should behave.</li>
<li>It is subject to future generations living by rules that
    don't account for new developments or their
    evolving interests and values.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Autonomy and liberty :<ul>
<li>A core assumption being that markets find
    an efficient equilibrium satisfying pareto optimality.</li>
<li>Prone to unexpected consequences.
    Granting all life forms
    a right to live, in effect would be banning all predators
    from their life as they knew it.
    In the extreme this would ban discrimination
    against non-human animals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Utilitarianism :<ul>
<li>subject to the Utility Monster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Diversity :<ul>
<li>Bayesian Thompson Sampling writ large.</li>
<li>Akin to playing a row of slot machines, in fact is
  often referred to as Multi-Armed Bandit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In short: It is difficult to codify ethics.</p>
<p>Rather than be paralyzed by our inability to codify ethics and
letting the perfect being be the enemy of the good,
begin with small steps.</p>
<p>He suggests we start with Kindergarten Ethics.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>My take-away of the intended message is that a
sufficiently ambitious goal executed efficiently
can and probably will lead to subgoals that
can and probably will cause problems for humans.</p>
<p>There are many systems that humankind created,
which seemed to take on a life of their own,
threatening to run away from us, some resulting in existential crisis.  Warcraft and ozone depletion are two examples.  So far, we’ve been able to recover in time and refactor these systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This means that to wisely decide what to do about AI development, we humans need to confront not only traditional computational challenges, but also some of the most obdurate questions in philosophy”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started out a skeptic of AI alarmism.
After reading this book, I take AI alarmism more seriously and
consider it to be more urgent than I did previously.
I previously thought that AI was indeed inevitable, but that
it was not inevitable for it to go rogue.  Moreover, even if
that were a possible outcome (which I felt it was), that we
had plenty of time to adapt it to us, and ourselves to it.</p>
<p>But if life truly is driven by deeper more fundamental laws
of nature that our programming is unable to suspend,
not only is this outcome more probable,
but it is inevitable unless we plan accordingly.
Moreover, this is a wicked difficult problem that will take
time to solve.</p>
<p>We’ve tackled other wicked difficult problems,
such as the tragedy of the commons in its numerous forms, and myriad impossibility theorems that would seem to doom us all. And yet, here we are.
Thus far we have always discovered a workaround to impending doom.
This is a problem that we can tackle, but it isn't enough to
just take an optimistic view that human ingenuity has always
triumphed over nature, and so it will again.
We need to have a deep fundamental understanding of life's
core drivers at its most fundamental level.</p>
<p>Understanding artificial intelligence is important,
but even more important is understanding artificial life.</p><p>There are <a href="https://pluteski.github.io/speech-to-text/review-of-max-tegmarks-life-30.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>	</article>
