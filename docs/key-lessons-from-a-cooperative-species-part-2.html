    <h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is Part 2 of a summary of the book <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9474.html">"A Cooperative Species, Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution"</a> By Samuel Bowles &amp; Herbert Gintis, 2011. Here is Part 0, and here is part 1.</p>
<p>This document is for educational purposes only. </p>
<p>Part 2 is about </p>
<h1>Chapter 5. Cooperative Homo economicus</h1>
<p>[ in this chapter they argue that the level of cooperation is impossible to model with only noncooperative game theory ]</p>
<p>a major goal of economic theory since its inception two and a half centuries ago has been to explain the mutual benefits provided by a widespread form of voluntary cooperation, market exchange among self-regarding individuals. </p>
<p>This endeavor culminated half a century ago in the fundamental theorem of welfare economics (Arrow and Debreu 1954, Debreu 1959, Arrow and Hahn 1971), sustaining Smith’s insight that self-regarding behaviors might support socially valued economic outcomes. </p>
<p>In the resulting model of exchange, individuals maximize their utility given a set of market-determined prices over which they exercise no control. They thus interact with a list of prices, not with one another. </p>
<p>As a result the essential condition for strategic behavior, recognition that the payoffs of each depend on the actions of others is absent. The reason that individuals are content to interact through prices alone, and hence have no incentive to engage in strategic personal interactions, is that all relevant aspects of exchanges are assumed to be covered by complete contracts, enforceable at no cost to the exchanging party. </p>
<p>A complete contract ensures that any aspect of an exchange in which the parties have an interest will be explicitly stated in the contract and implemented as specified. The enforcement of the contract in case of breach is entrusted to a third party, generally the courts, and is assumed to impose no costs on the injured party</p>
<p>[ they go on to argue that complete contracts are practically impossible without institutions, and even with institutions are largely ineffective  </p>
<p>even presupposing extraordinary cognitive capacities and levels of patience among the cooperating individuals, there is no reason to believe that a group of more than two individuals would ever discover the cooperative Nash equilibria that the models have identified, and if it were to hit on one, its members would almost certainly abandon it in short order. Except under implausible conditions, the cooperative outcomes identified by these models are neither accessible nor persistent. We term them evolutionarily irrelevant Nash equilibria.</p>
<h2>5.1 Folk Theorems and Evolutionary Dynamics</h2>
<p>The authors use a common phrase “folk theorem” to refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_theorem_(game_theory)">a class of game theories</a>. This phrase is commonly used by economists and is not intended in a pejorative manner. These are called “folk” theorems because they were so widely known among game theorists in the 1950’s even though no one had published them.  In a sense, they were donated to the community -- a notable act of altruism by otherwise ardent proponents of self-interest!</p>
<p>All <strong>folk theorems</strong> are based on a <strong>stage game</strong>, that is, an interaction played an indefinite number of times, with a constant, strictly positive, probability that in each period the game will continue for an additional period </p>
<p>A strategy in this game that dictates following one course of action until a certain condition is met and then following a different strategy for the rest of the game is called a <strong>trigger strategy</strong></p>
<p>[ it turns out that the existence of trigger strategies is an achilles heal for folk theorem models ] 
it is [extremely difficult to] come to a working arrangement among … many independent spirits, <em>in the absence of a regulating social institution to which all are committed</em>. </p>
<p>the n-player reciprocal altruism model can sustain a high level of cooperation only in very small groups</p>
<p>[Apparently] directed punishment appears to solve the problem of cooperation in large groups. There is a catch, however. Because punishing costs the punisher, self-regarding players have no incentive to carry out the punishment. Thus, this model does not work assuming self-regarding players. We have seen in Chapter 3 that people avidly punish defectors even at a cost to themselves, providing a solution to this problem, but one that is based on social preferences rather than self-interest. </p>
<p><strong>this coordination problem is [largely because] the information each has on the others’ actions is subject to error.</strong> </p>
<h2>5.3 The Folk Theorem with Private Information</h2>
<p>[ The problem gets even worse with private information.  To summarize, the only way the alternative theory based on self-regarding homo economicus can work is if all information is public and all agents are omniscient ]</p>
<p>There is another approach to constructing Nash equilibria for repeated games with private signals [ that actually DOES work, but where ] players use strictly mixed strategies (that is, they randomize over various actions rather than taking a single action) in each period.</p>
<p>[ They claim that human players cannot or will not ever actually use such mixed strategies.  -- However, it turns out that AI agents could -- meaning if the agents are algorithms then coordination is possible even where information is private, by AI using mixed strategies. ]</p>
<p>A mixed strategy for a player is a probabilistic combination of pure strategies, such as playing heads or tails each with 50% probability in a pennies-matching game. </p>
<h2>5.4 Evolutionarily Irrelevant Equilibria</h2>
<p>The folk theorem provides no reason to believe that players would ever coordinate [and] should this occur by chance the equilibrium would [not last very long]. </p>
<p>It is plausible that individuals are [able to coordinate] given full knowledge of the game and the choices of the other players. But when knowledge is imperfect or private and the choices of the other players are not known [i.e., other agents are not omniscient mind-readers then folk theorems fail and fail miserably ].</p>
<p>[It turns out that we now know that] Nash equilibrium are [extremely difficult to find and maintain] except in the simplest of cases (1995). </p>
<ul>
<li>The problem with achieving a Nash equilibrium is that individuals may have heterogeneous and incompatible beliefs concerning how other players will behave, </li>
<li>and indeed what other players believe concerning one’s own behavior. </li>
<li>Therefore, individuals may choose best responses to strategies that the other players in fact are not playing, resulting in game play that is far from any Nash equilibrium. </li>
<li>the conditions required for players to implement a Nash equilibrium in all but the simplest games cannot be deduced from the assumption that the players are rational [in the neoclassical sense] i.e., that they choose best responses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fatal flaws of the folk theorem (classical econ) approach:</p>
<p>If there is a Nash equilibrium with private signals, individuals have no particular incentive to play the strategies that implement the equilibrium, because 
many other strategies have the same payoffs as the equilibrium payoffs. 
Moreover, as we have seen, the equilibrium exists only if private signals are very close to being public, so all individuals receive nearly the same signal concerning the behavior of any given group member. 
When this is not the case, the equilibrium will not exist. 
Thus, these models apply only to forms of cooperation where all members observe the actions of (nearly) all others with a high level of accuracy.</p>
<p>[ In other words, the classical econ theories only work with inhuman players ]</p>
<h2>5.5 Social Norms and Correlated Equilibria</h2>
<p>There is an alternative game-theoretic equilibrium concept that does not share the weaknesses associated with the Nash equilibrium described above: <strong>the correlated equilibrium</strong> [with a correlating device].</p>
<p>A correlating device is something that sends out signals, private or public, to the players of a game, indicating which pure strategy each should play. </p>
<p>A correlated equilibrium is a situation in which there is a correlating device such that, if all players follow the advice of the correlating device, no player can do better by switching to an alternative strategy.</p>
<p>correlated equilibrium rather than Nash equilibrium is the appropriate equilibrium concept for game theory. </p>
<ul>
<li>Assuming players have common knowledge of the game, its rules, and its payoffs, as well as a common belief concerning the probability of the natural events (the so-called moves by Nature) associated with the game, the strategies chosen by rational individuals can then always be modeled as a correlated equilibrium with an appropriate correlating device. </li>
<li>The notion of a correlating device is quite abstract, but one form of correlating device is well known and performs precisely the social function of signaling actions to individuals that, when followed, may lead to a socially efficient outcome. This device is the social norm which, like the choreographer in a ballet, is instituted to issue precise instructions that, when followed, produce the desired outcome. </li>
<li>For instance, the system of traffic lights in a city’s street network instruct drivers when to stop and when to go, and it is normally in the interest of drivers to obey these signals as long as others do so, to avoid accidents. [ i.e., drivers obey a social norm ]</li>
</ul>
<p>A cooperative equilibrium supported by social norms is one in which not only is the equilibrium strategy evolutionarily stable, but also the social norms are themselves an evolutionary adaptation, stable against invasion by competing social norms</p>
<p>we posit that groups have social norms specifying how a game ought to be played and that these norms are identified as social norms by group members</p>
<p>Social norms do not ensure equilibrium, because error, mutation,migration, deliberate violation of the norm, and other dynamical forces may lead individuals to reject beliefs or behavior fostered by the norm. </p>
<ul>
<li>This may occur because the beliefs might conflict with an individual’s personal experience, </li>
<li>or its suggested behavior may be rejected as not in the individual’s best interest; </li>
<li>i.e., the action fostered by a social norm must be a best response to the behaviors of the other group members, given the beliefs engendered by the social norm and the individual’s updating. </li>
<li>Moreover, social norms cannot be introduced as a deus ex machina, as if laid down by a centralized authority, without violating the objective to provide a “bottom-up” theory of cooperation that does not presuppose preexisting institutional forms of cooperation. </li>
<li>Social norm are thus discretionary, because any institution that is posited to enforce behavior should itself be modeled within the dynamical system, unless plausible reasons are given for taking a macro-level institution as unproblematically given. </li>
<li>Nor are social norms fixed in stone. A group’s social norms are themselves subject to change, those groups producing better outcomes for their members sometimes but not always displacing groups with less effective social norms, and changing social and demographic conditions leading to the evolutionary transformation of social norms within groups</li>
</ul>
<h2>5.6 The Missing Choreographer</h2>
<p>[The] celebrated <strong>fundamental</strong> (“invisible hand”) <strong>theorem of welfare economics</strong> ... purports to model decentralized market interactions, but on close inspection requires an extraordinary level of coordination that is not explained, but rather is posited as a deus ex machina.</p>
<p>Humans are ... exceptional among living creatures in the degree and range of cooperation among large numbers of substantially unrelated individuals. </p>
<ul>
<li>The global division of labor and exchange, the modern democratic welfare state, and contemporary warfare alike evidence our distinctiveness. </li>
<li>These forms of cooperation emerged historically and are today sustained as a result of the interplay of self-regarding and social preferences operating under the influence of group-level institutions of governance and socialization that favor cooperators, </li>
<li>in part by helping to coordinate their actions so as to target transgressions for punishment and thus protect them from exploitation by defectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The norms and institutions that have accomplished this evolved over millennia through trial and error</p>
<p>the private nature of information, as we have seen, makes it virtually impossible to coordinate the targeted punishment of miscreants</p>
<p>In many hunter-gatherer societies the relevant information that would in other societies be private is rendered public by such cooperative customs as eating in public so that violations of sharing norms can be easily detected. Cooperative Japanese shrimp fishermen who pool income across boats deliberately land their catch at an appointed time of day for the same reason </p>
<p>But in most modern societies, where larger numbers are involved, converting private information about transgressions to public information that can provide the basis of punishment often involves civil or criminal trials, elaborate processes that have evolved over centuries and that rely on commonly agreed upon rules of evidence and ethical norms of appropriate behavior. Even with the benefit of these preexisting social preferences, these complex institutions frequently fail to transform the private protestations of innocence and guilt into common knowledge</p>
<p>Second, ... cooperation often unravels when the withdrawal of cooperation by the civic-minded intending to punish a defector is mistaken by others as itself a violation of a cooperative norm, inviting a spiral of further defections. </p>
<ul>
<li>In virtually all surviving societies with substantial populations, this problem is addressed by the creation of a corps of specialists entrusted with carrying out the more severe of society’s punishments. </li>
<li>Their uniforms convey the civic purpose of the punishments they mete out, </li>
<li>their professional norms, it is hoped, ensure that the power to punish is not used for personal gain. </li>
<li>Like court proceedings, these policing, penal, and related institutions work imperfectly</li>
</ul>
