# Chapter 4. The Sociobiology of Human Cooperation
“I shall argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful gene is ruthless selfishness. This gene for selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual behavior.” -- Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene (1976)

“Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence, nothing can be effected. … social and moral qualities would tend … be diffused throughout the world. Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man (1873)

[ ed. I think they agree with Darwin ]

Several advances occurred:

* The central importance of social structure [was convincingly argued by] Edward O. Wilson in his massively influential The Insect Societies (1971) and Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975)
* 1970, George Price provided an ingenious method for the analysis of selection processes operating at multiple levels, providing a way to study the evolution of social behavior in group-structured populations [ this shows how behaviors can emerge at a group level that are not evident at the lower level -- even though genes are selfish, groups can behave altruistically ] 
* This is known as “multi-level selection”
* Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman published “Cultural versus Biological Inheritance” (1973a), [arguing for] **gene-culture coevolution**
* in 1973, John Maynard Smith and Price published “The Logic of Animal Conflict”
This paper launched the field of evolutionary game theory

multi-level selection may be of considerably greater importance among humans than among other animals given the 

* advanced level of human cognitive and linguistic capabilities and 
* consequent capacity to maintain group boundaries and 
* to formulate general rules of behavior for large groups, and 
* the resulting substantial influence of cultural inheritance on human behavior 

Among the consequences of these distinctive human capacities are the suppression of within-group phenotypic differences through egalitarianism, coinsurance, consensus decision making and conformist cultural transmission. 

Other animals do some of these things, but none does all of them on a human scale. 

* All of these aspects of human social life enhance the force of between-group selection relative to within-group selection. 
* A result, if we are correct, was the evolution this cooperative species. 

### Competing alternative explanations
A rather different interpretation of human altruism and its evolution is that, on closer inspection, most apparently altruistic forms of helping are just self-interest with a long time horizon. 


* This approach takes **reciprocal altruism** as its starting point and shows how, when interactions are **frequently repeated**, individuals may enhance their fitness by a **mutualistic** form of helping based on the **expectation of reciprocation in the future**. 
* Variants of this approach developed in models of **indirect reciprocity** and **costly signaling** show that helping others may be repaid not only by the targets of one’s help but also by others wishing preferentially to be associated with the helpful.

### Competing models explaining cooperation in human society :

1. Inclusive Fitness -- 1930, 1964
* Kin-based Altruism -- 1964 
* Group-based Altruism (multi-level selection) -- 1977 , 1982,  1990 
* Network-based Altruism  -- 2006 
1. Reciprocal Altruism & Mutualism -- 1971 
* Signaling Reputation -- 1973 , 1990 , 1975 
* Indirect Reciprocity -- 1987 , 1986 
* Repeated Games Folk Theorem -- 1981 , 1986 

[ An important parameter in these models is what economists term the rate of time preference ]

[For example ] : reciprocal altruism can piggyback on kin-based altruism to get started

[ It may be that humans are able to mentally simulate the future better, or, have a longer time preference parameter, because ] non-human animals are extraordinarily impatient. Behaviors that at first appeared to be **reciprocal** have frequently, on further study, been better explained as **simple mutualism** in which the benefit to the actor compensates for the cost of the action regardless of the action taken by the other.

# 4.5 Reciprocal Altruism in Large Groups

To illustrate the consequences of extending the reciprocal altruism model to groups larger than two, we will develop an **agent-based model**.  A large population consists of N groups of n members each, and each group plays a public goods game repeatedly d times. We will call this series of **d rounds** an **encounter**. 

# 4.6 Reputation: Indirect Reciprocity
[ here they steel man a competing theory ]

The **standing model** 

* An alternative mechanism of cooperation [where] individuals [remember] who cooperated with their partners in the previous period and those who did not. 
* an individual who cooperated in the previous period [is considered to be] “in good standing”, 
* the only way an individual can fall into bad standing is by defecting on a partner who is in good standing. 
* Thus, an individual can always defect when his partner is in bad standing without losing his good standing status. 
* the “standing strategy” is : cooperate if and only if your current partner is in good standing, except that if you accidentally defected the previous period, cooperate in this period unconditionally, thereby restoring your status as a member in good standing. 

**Indirect reciprocity** and **signaling models** are similar in that the payback for the individual’s cooperative action comes from third parties.

The two models differ in a subtle way: 
in the signaling model the third party responds favorably because the signal is correlated with some desirable but unobservable property of the actor; 
in the indirect reciprocity model the signal (cooperating with those in good standing) is the desirable property itself. 

In the case of indirect reciprocity, I want to associate with the hunter who shares his ample prey with other members of the group because I too would like a share of meat. 

In the signaling model I want to associate with him because the fact that he has lots of meat to share indicates that he is physically able and would be a good mate or coalition partner. [ it is correlated with some other desirable quality ]
