# 14 key lessons of cooperative economics - introduction
This is the introduction to this series or articles, titled "14 Lessons of Cooperative Economics". These lessons were largely gleaned from the book ["A Cooperative Species, Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution"](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/9474.html) By Samuel Bowles & Herbert Gintis, 2011. 

**This is for you if**:

* You’ve wanted to read this book but were intimidated by its [275 page length](http://library.uniteddiversity.coop/Cooperatives/A_Cooperative_Species-Human_Reciprocity_and_Its_Evolution.pdf)).
* You’re puzzled by how the way some people behave doesn’t seem to be in their self-interest, and want to understand these seemingly irrational behaviors.
* You have a deep interest in game theory and social psychology.
* You've followed classical economics but somehow didn't really buy its explanation of how people really behave. 
* You're interested in evolutionary economics and behavioral economics.
* You are interested in how decentralized consensus is achieved in small to large groups of people.
* You're interested in the intersection of economics, psychology, and sociology.
* You enjoy listicles. This summary often breaks down key concepts into their constituents in bulleted list format for clarity and brevity. 

# Tl;dr

The authors are keen to prove the following points: 

* Cooperative economics gives a fuller explanation of how people behave in group decision-making settings than classical economics. 

However, that is not the focus of this series. Others are better suited to debate the science behind their data. That said, assuming that the science **is** sound there my key takeaways are the following: 

* Mechanisms of cooperative economics provide an effective way of decentralizing group consensus. 
* The sometimes puzzling manner in which people behave in teams can be explained by how group dynamics trigger social emotions tied to internalized group norms. 

Another set of key takeaways is that co-operation is less likely in the following situations:

* when there are many participants, 
* when interactions are infrequent, 
* when the time horizon is short, or 
* when others' actions cannot be clearly observed.

In other words, people who are guided by moral reasoning will change their behavior when they are thrust into situations where that moral reasoning is less effective and possibly risky.

Non-cooperative mechanisms (that is to say, purely competitive, "self-interested" mechanisms) are most suitable when:

* Interactions are infrequent.
* Participants are not human.
* Participants are anonymous.
* Participants cannot communicate.

# Background
In the interest of making this more succinct, the reader is asked to look up key terminology, [which is defined in this document](https://pluteski.github.io/speech-to-text/glossary-of-cooperative-games.html
). That document provides a glossary of terms, as well as some mini-primers on Game Theory, Agent Based Modeling, Evolutionary Economics, and Dynamical Systems. This choice makes these articles less self-contained; however, I deemed that preferable to the much greater length that would have been required to introduce each term, boring many of the intended audience.

# The book's message
The key message of the books’ authors is that the way people behave in every day life is explained most fully by cooperative economics.

This is not to say that classical economics, behavioral economics, evolutionary economics do not predict it -- just that cooperative mechanisms resolve certain paradoxes and fill in gaps left by the prevailing ideas.

# My key takeaways
This document will focus more on core takeaways instead of methodology. If we assume that the book's claims are correct, then how can its lessons be used in today's world?  Many of its insights are (still) explained by the ‘conventional wisdom’, such as kinship, mutualism, and signaling, as well as by evolutionary theory, culture, and institutions. 

This article covers the main claims of the book. [The next part in this series, Part 1](https://pluteski.github.io/speech-to-text/key-lessons-from-a-cooperative-species-part-1.html) gives an overview of competing alternative explanations. [Then, Part 2](https://pluteski.github.io/speech-to-text/key-lessons-from-a-cooperative-species-part-2.html) summarizes their arguments that human-level cooperation is impossible to model with only non-cooperative game theory. [The final part in this series, Part 3](https://pluteski.github.io/speech-to-text/key-lessons-from-a-cooperative-species-part-3.html) puts things into context with evolutionary game theory and the rise of institutions. 

Because this is a summary overview of a lengthy but dense book, for the purpose of brevity many of the explanations will be terse with little elaboration.

The key takeaways are outlined below in the section "Key lessons of cooperative economics."

# Summary of key concepts

Modeling the complex processes underlying human cooperation is a major challenge of contemporary science.

Conventional wisdom in biology and economics is that the reasons why people cooperate so effectively and generously can be fully explained by far-sighted self-interest or to the desire to help close kin. Supposedly, the reason why people make sacrifices to uphold group norms and to help total strangers is just an extension of the following: 

* Enlightened self-interest.
* Mutualistic form of helping based on the expectation of reciprocation in the future.
* Indirect reciprocity.
* Virtue signaling.

This book argues that these cannot fully explain the full extent of human generosity -- or for that matter bitter vindictiveness.  


>> Economic theory, favoring parsimony over realism, has sought to explain cooperation without reference to social preferences, and with a minimalist or fictive description of social institutions. This research trajectory, as we have seen, has produced significant insights. But it may have run its course.

#### Role of social emotions
Cooperation with fellow group members is essential to survival. Groups that protect the civic-minded from exploitation by the selfish are more effective and are able to compete better with less cooperative groups. Key to this process are the social emotions such as shame and guilt. 

## Ethics and Morals
People internalize social norms in the form of morals.  However, moral judgment is not just relying upon rational thought or even deep seated intuition; rather it is based on social emotions that lay deeper still. For certain acts of altruistic kindness (or revenge), acting ethically is a personal goal rather than simply to prudent way to avoid punishment. 

## Decentralized Consensus and Execution 
Internalizing norms and enforcing them using strategies that are triggered by social emotions turns out to be an excellent way to decentralize the means of coordinating the behavior of groups of people, both for small groups as well as larger ones. The key tasks that group decision-make requires include:

* Generating proposals about what should be done next and what could be done better.
* Deciding on what to do next and on rules of conduct. 
* Communicating the plans and rules to everyone in the group.
* Enforcing the plans and rules. 

Humans utilize sophisticated means of transitioning between self-interested non-cooperative behavior and altruistic cooperative behavior, layering different strategies upon each other to handle situations that require one, or the other, or a mixture of both. We do it so effortlessly that we take it for granted.  It is not as simple as many scientists and economists would like to make it out to be -- and so it is not as favored as explanations that rely on a (supposedly) simpler form of game theory. But, when the supposedly simpler forms of game theory have to be twisted and turned into devices approaching Rube Goldberg machines in complexity, they end up being more complicated explanation after all. 

* Lesson 1: People are naturally cooperative
* Lesson 2: Institutions are important but limited
* Lesson 3: Altruism is red in tooth and claw
* Lesson 4: The three habits of highly effective groups
* Lesson 5: Society is based on psychology
* Lesson 6: Social preferences exist and are not due to self-interest alone
* Lesson 7: Strong Reciprocity Is Common
* Lesson 8: Free-Riders Undermine Cooperation
* Lesson 9: Effective Punishment Depends on Legitimacy
* Lesson 10: Social Preferences Are Not Irrational
* Lesson 11: Though limited, culture and institutions matter greatly
* Lesson 12: Behavior Is Conditioned on Group Membership
* Lesson 13: People Enjoy Cooperating and Punishing Free-Riders
* Lesson 14: "internalized" does not imply "innate"

Each of these is explored in the next part.
