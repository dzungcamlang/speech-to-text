This document provides background on my influences that I sometimes use to explain the biographical aspects that have influenced my perspective. Feel free to skip the parts that are not relevant to the article from which this linked.

# My background 

I've already lived through a generation that experienced large upheaval and migration due to automation. I grew up on a farm. I moved to California because of economics. The 10x production improvements that technology brought to farming made it less economical for farmers having less than a certain critical mass of acreage.  

Our family farm was considered to be medium-sized when I was young, but once it came time for me to choose a career, it suddenly seemed small. I was always interested in science and wanted to pursue that interest anyways, so it was a bit of a relief not to feel obligated to carry on the family business. My parents had bought me the [World Book Encyclopedia](https://www.worldbook.com/world-book-encyclopedia-2018) in grade school, and I had read it A through Z, including every one of the Yearbook and Science Year supplements. 

There wasn't a slot for me in the regional economy where I was born and raised so I moved west.  I came for the surf and somehow ended up with an [Erdős Number of 4](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ErdosNumber.html). 

### How did I come to machine learning?
I had an interest in parallel processing beginning in college. I was studying [dataflow architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture) at USC when I encountered [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network). I immediately knew that this was somehow more appealing than the dataflow architecture, which was fiddly and difficult to tune. Learning from data seemed like a good idea whose time had come. The field was just emerging from what had been called the [AI Winter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter). I had myself already worked as a [Lisp programmer in a role called a "knowledge engineer" developing expert systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_collapse_of_the_Lisp_machine_market_in_1987). Little did I know I would live through another AI Winter, despite [AI already being around you every second of the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#AI_behind_the_scenes).

As a member of [GURU](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/guru/index.html) I met the future [Godfather of Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton), the inventor of [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory#History), and other true believers of [connectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#Parallel_distributed_processing). I [took a seminar on consciousness taught by Francis Crick](https://biology.ucsd.edu/about/news/article_070303.html).  I did a two year internship at [Hecht Nielsen Neurocomputer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hecht-Nielsen), which was enlightened enough to incentivize me with my very first incentive stock options. It IPO’d, allowing me to buy my first house in California.  I went on to apply machine learning in myriad data-driven domains, including audio, video, medical, e-commerce, web analytics, consumer electronics, and consumer application.

### How did I become interested in social psychology?
I had a keen interest in psychology as a teenager, and wanted to study it in college, but chose the more pragmatic path of electrical engineering. In my first job out of college, I worked as a software engineer, and ended up working in what back then qualified as AI -- [knowledge engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_engineering) programmed in [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_Machine_Lisp) using [Symbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics#History) lisp machines. Later on, I was enrolled in the cognitive science interdisciplinary program at UCSD -- but was a bit ahead of my time. I wanted to study the underlying models (the neural networks) and not spend much if any time collecting the data. This turned out to be a lucky happenstance anyway, because I was able to dive deep into algorithm development and econometrics. At the time, connectionists and most other [neural net freaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionism#Neural_networks) were closeted psychologists. However, it wasn't until my experience doing big data analytics on large datasets obtained from the usage of hundreds of millions of users that I realized that I was more interested in social psychology. People are individuals -- but in the aggregate, usage data turns out to be very predictive of how groups behave. I've known this for over a decade after building machine learning models that successfully predicted user demographics and psychographics. 

According to Christos Papadimitriou (from whom I had the pleasure of taking the algorithms course at UCSD): 

>> The Internet changed Computer Science (and Theoretical Computer Science) it turned it into a physical science… …and a social science. -- [Algorithmic Game Theory bootcamp](https://slideplayer.com/slide/7704339/). 

### How did I come to economics?
I had an entrepreneurial interest early in my career, dating back to college where I took an introductory economics course. That consisted of the usual introduction to the only two types of economics that were taught: macro and micro.  I surmised that this topic was not relevant to the path that I planned to follow and summarily dismissed it. Later on, I received a thorough introduction to econometrics by the author of the most-cited paper in economics since 1970, who had agreed to be my dissertation advisor.  He also had a strong interest in neural networks. 

I believe in using principles as a guiding light to illuminate career path and help with difficult choices. One of my bedrock principles was: "be data-driven". HNC Software was one of the first organizations to popularize the term "data-driven" in the 1990's, and I saw the light -- I became an ardent proponent data-driven methodology a decade before the term "[data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science#History)" became popularized.  

Over time, the phrase "data-driven" began to pick up multiple connotations.  One was the notion of "data-driven evidence."  However, others emerged, such as the notion of data-driven _storytelling_ to explain an approach. Another is monetization -- data as a proxy for a user's identity that can be sold to parties that want to promote their brand, goods or services to that user. I eventually realized that the type of data-driven methodology that described my core values was about incentivizing humans to become better at what they do less, and less about storytelling, post-hoc justification, and monetization. A better principle emerged, namely: "incentivization." This is when I discovered my inner economist. 

### Algorithmic Econometrics
My dissertation research centered around creating algorithms for **active learning**, where a machine learner plays an active role in selecting its training examples rather than being a passive learner. The active learning algorithm I had created, [which essentially does gradient descent in example space](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0893608095000992?via%3Dihub), was motivated by my own [parallel research into econometrics](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/762-cross-validation-estimates-imse). This algorithm is able to distill the training set for (what at the time was a challenging semi-chaotic time series known as) the Mackey-Glass time series to an [economical 25 exemplars](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gary/pubs/pluto.nips92.pdf).

### What I'm thinking about now
A large shift is happening in machine learning. While developments in deep learning have justifiably captured the popular imagination, a different area of machine learning is experiencing a different resurgence, one that promises to be as impactful as deep learning. Economics, econometrics, machine learning and algorithmic computational science are dovetailing into an emerging field called algorithmic game theory.
